Development Strategy

It's very important that you plan your project before you start writing any code. Break your project down into small pieces of work and plan out your approach to each one. It's much easier to debug and fix an issue if you've only made a small change. It becomes much harder if you wait longer to test your code. You don't build a house all at once, but brick by brick.

-Start by building a very simple grid of cards.
    -Don't worry about styling, just get something clickable on the page.
    -Figure out the HTML needed to represent a card. Remember, you have to represent two sides of the card. Are you going to have two separate elements stacked on top of each other?
-Add the functionality to handle clicks.
    -This should reveal the hidden side of each card.
-Work on the matching logic. How does your game "know" if a player guesses correctly or incorrectly?
-Work on the winning condition. How does your game “know” if a player has won?

We recommend saving styling until the very end. Allow your game logic and functionality to dictate the styling.
