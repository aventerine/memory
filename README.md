# Memory Game Project

This is the Memory Game I created for the FEND Memory Game Project.

# Instructions

Flip the cards to find the matching pairs. Once all pairs are found you win the game.

# Dependencies

Works on most recent Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox browsers.
I use Font Awesome for the images and Lobster for the font.
